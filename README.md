## Description


<div align="justify"> 

This tool was created for handling high-resolution images from the Opera Phenix Plus High-Content
Screening System, including operations such as concatenating raw series of images, z-projection,
channel merging, image resizing, etc. Additionally, we have included options for annotating specific
parts of images and selecting them for further analysis, for example, teaching ML/AI algorithms.

Certain elements of this tool can be adapted for data analysis and annotation in other imaging systems.
For more information, please feel free to contact us!

##### 7.1.2 Metadat repairing

Function:

```
repair_image(image_info, dispaly_plot = True)
```

> Description:\
  This function is used for repairing microscope image-taking errors.

  Sometimes microscope takes photos out of the targeted place or misses one photo and then the full photo can not be merged.
  This function allows for automatic repair of the core of the full image.
  If the core is still not appropriate use manual repair by manual_outlires() function.
